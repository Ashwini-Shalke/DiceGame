# DiceGame
Swift Project to roll the 3D Dice.

## How it works?
Basically, the 3D Dice will rotate on the click of the start button and will stop rotating with some random side of the Dice on click of the stop button.

Additonally, you can see the animations added to the start and stop button and also implemented the haptic and taptic.
