# DiceGame
Swift Project to roll the 3D Dice.

## How it works?
Basically, the app is launched with start button, you can see the 3D Dice rotating, when you click on the stop button, you will see the cube will stop rotating withthe random number on it. 

Additonally, you can see the animations added to the start and stop button and also implemented the haptic and taptic.
